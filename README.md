# SGDK project builder
A small utility  that removes the need to enter a command in CMD each time when building a SGDK project

## How to use?

1) Create an eviroment variable called "GDK" and set it to your SGDK path. For example, `C:\sgdk`
2) Put an .exe file to your project's folder
3) Execute it. Results you'll find in "out" folder. 


### PS

This utility was developed just for fun. I guess, it's better to use setted up VSCode. But if you don't want to install VSCode, this utility can be usefull.
